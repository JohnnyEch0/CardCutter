# MPC FILL EDGE REMOVER - exe branch
This is a simple tool to process a folder of card images downloaded from [mpcfill.com](https://mpcfill.com/) into images files of fixed dimensions whilst removing the bleed-borders which they use for cutting.
Right now I was to lazy to add more flags and a flag parser, might add it later.

Some math was stolen from [preshtildeath](https://github.com/preshtildeath/print-proxy-prep/blob/main/main.py#L129) 

## Usage
- Download .exe and put into the folder with your downloaded mpcfill images
- Execute the .exe and change parameters if you wish (to cut more or less of a cutting edge, change dimensions, do a test run etc.)
